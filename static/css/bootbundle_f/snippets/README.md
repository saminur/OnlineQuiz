Snippets
========
A collection of HTML/CSS/JavaScript code examples that demonstrate functionality.

This folder contains a collection of code snippets that include working HTML,
CSS and/or JavaScript examples. Snippets are categorized by each provider/author.

What is a "Snippet"?

A "snippet" may demonstrate any type of functionality, but usually with a singular purpose.
This includes anything from a few simple lines of HTML, to a complete working component such as the AngularJS ToDo MVC example. As a general rule, snippets do not contain multi-page or templating features. Additionally, snippets assets (images and require css/js dependencies) are referenced from an external location, usually from a CDN (ie; MaxCDN or JSCDN) since these are optimized for performance and host many common
libaries and microframeworks.

For "full" examples see the "Templates".


Templates
=========

A collection of complete, static sites built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and
designed for customization and re-use. A template is a complete package that is deployable to any standard Web server.

A "Template" usually contains multiple pages with various types of functionality. A template contains a broad set of features, whereas a snippet generally demonstrates a single feature. A Template usually maintain there own CSS and JavaScript asset files, except for those assets that are hosted on an external CDN. 


Themes
========

A collection of themes/skins that are desiged for use within a template or static site.

What is a "Theme"?

The term "Theme" is overused, and often mistaken for a working "Template". There are numerous
theme Websites that in fact market working templates and not just a "Theme". In this context, a Theme is only the style layer or "skin". A theme is defined by a CSS (LESS or SASS) stylesheet
that is designed for use withing a snippet or template. "Templates" are often used to demonstrate
"Themes".

FAQ

What's in BootBundle?

It's a package of premium templates, themes, snippets, components, fonts and
high-quality assets designed to enhance Bootstrap. In addition to making use of Bootstrap's powerful responsive features, BootBundle's snippets and templates are designed to work cross-browser, on any device.

It's not just about Bootstrap. BootBundle components use sustainable technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and modern JavaScript. The bundle includes high-quality royalty-free images, and working examples that utilize popular plugins, API's and social media tools such as Isotope, Google Maps and Facebook.

What's on the BootBundle Roadmap?

Although BootBundle was built with the Bootstrap developer in mind, we're working on sustainability. We're working to include components in the bundle that utilize HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript features that will be sustainable down the road. We'll continue to add features, and re-bundle as components are updated periodically.

What's the difference between a Template and a Theme?

What's the difference between a Template and a Snippet?

What is the license?

Each component has it's own license terms. Most are MIT, CC and GNU Public.



Are you just bundling free, open source software and re-selling it?

The free bundle contains some the best (IMO) offerings that are currently available for the latest Bootstrap 3 (yes, goodbye 2.x). We've brought them all together in a single bundle as fully integrated, working components.

The premium bundle includes even more components and integrated examples. Additionally it contains a collection of premium templates and examples that are exclusive to BootBundle, and are not freely available elsewhere. These exclusing templates compare to those being sold at a higher cost on theme marketplaces such as ThemeForest and WrapBootsrap.

When you buy any premium offering, you're buying the service and maintainence that goes along with it. BootBundle is no exception. While you can find and download many of the BootBundle components individually, you won't find integrated examples that bring all together. That's why thousands of developers/authors earn revenue selling templates and themes.

Finding the latest and greatest stuff is not a trivial task, not to mention organizing it and maintaining it. The service we provide keeps the entire bundle up-to-date. There is a considerable level of cost and effort involved with maintaining BootBundle. Many open source projects are abandoned. That's why we're commited to monitoring all of the bundle components. As components are released and updated, a new BootBundle is released periodically.
